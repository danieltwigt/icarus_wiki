Satellite Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) is a critical phase in satellite manufacturing, ensuring the functionality and reliability of space-bound assets. AIT engineering demands a diverse skill set encompassing system knowledge, procedural expertise, tool proficiency, and safety awareness, among others. However, the high costs and limited availability of required hardware often pose challenges for hands-on training.

To address these challanges, `ATG Europe`_, `ISISpace`_ and `NLR`_ have developed ICARUS, an immersive environment that allows for training of AIT procedures in Virtual Reality (VR). This enables users to reduce costs associated with training of (new) employees, enables them to reduce the effort required in the coordination with and training of their industry partners (system level manufacturers, launch organisations and customers), and contributes to risk reduction in the AIT process in general.

ICARUS offers a holistic training experience of the full AIT process, focusing on the key phases in the AIT process, and operational competencies related to these. Overall competencies which are trained are **knowledge**, **skills** and **attitide**, including various supporting competencies related to these.

ICARUS will enable users to improve the efficiently, increase the flexibility and decrease the risk of their assembly and integration processes considerably. Are you interested in the benefits which ICARUS could offer your company? :ref:`contact`.
